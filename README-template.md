## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about form development and validation. I've done it before but it was a very nice refresher. I also tried out making sure it was more accessible. I think I helped but am somewhat unsure. I'll definitely look into it further in the future.
